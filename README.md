# Introduction

This is a C++ implementation of OpenTLD that was originally published in MATLAB by Zdenek Kalal. OpenTLD is used for tracking objects in video streams. What makes this algorithm outstanding is that it does not make use of any training data. This implementation is based solely on open source libraries, meaning that you do not need any commercial products to compile or run it.

A documentation of the internals as well as other possibly helpful information is contained in this [master thesis](https://github.com/downloads/gnebehay/OpenTLD/gnebehay_thesis_msc.pdf).

This fork of OpenTLD is meant as a library to be used in computer and embedded applications
